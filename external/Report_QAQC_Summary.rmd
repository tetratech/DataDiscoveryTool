#QC TESTS, BY PARAMETER
* **Gross Range Test (Gross):** Test if data point exceeds sensor or user defined min/max.  The values are user defined based on parameter being measured and measuring instrument.
* **Spike Test (Spike):** Test if data point exceeds a user defined threshold relative to the previous data point.  The user defined values are based on the parameter being measured.
* **Rate of Change Test (RoC):** Test if a data point exceeds a number of standard deviations from the previous data points over a user defined time period.  Default is a 25 hour time period and 3 standard deviations.
* **Flat Line Test (Flat):** Test if a data point is within a user defined threshold from previous data points over a user defined range.  Default is 3 previous points for suspect and 5 points for failure.  The threshold is user defined and based on the measured parameter and sensitivity of the measuring instrument.
